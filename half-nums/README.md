# Half Numbers Method

### How this method works:
Firstly, script gets the maximum and minimum value from user.
Sencondly, gets half of the aperture.
Then, checks the value if it's greater, lower or equals to the number.
If it's higher sets value as new maximum value, else sets as new minimum value.
Repeats until number and value is equal.

### Project types:
1) Gets max, min and the number at start
2) Gets max and min at start, then asks user to check if the number greater or lower
